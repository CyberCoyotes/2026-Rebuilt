## Phase 0.5: Shooting with Vision (Now)

- [ ] Build state machines for Shooter, Indexer, Vision, Intake
- [ ] Get basic shooting working (manual alignment, manual adjust hood, preset distances)
- [ ] Collect data for interpolation
- [ ] Add vision alignment for stationary shots

## Phase 1: Vision-assisted stationary shooting (Comp 1)

- [ ] Flywheel/hood adjust based on LL4 distance
- [ ] Robot auto-aligns rotationally
- [ ] This should be competition-ready

## Phase 2 (if time): Aim assist while moving (Comp 2)

- [ ] Driver translation + vision rotation
- [ ] Continuous tracking mode
- [ ] Predict shot based on movement

## Phase 3 : Turret (???)

- [ ] Only if previous Phases are rock solid
- [ ] Hardware + software redesign
- [ ] Shoot-on-the-move becomes primary strategy
